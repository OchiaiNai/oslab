# oslab
Operating System-based projects explored and implemented chapter-wise. 
The programs are inspired from end-of-chapter projects in Silberchatz's _Operating System Concepts_.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. These programs are mostly tested on Linux Ubuntu. They might not run on Windows; you will need a **Linux OS** to run them.
2. You will need a **Terminal** to execute commands.
3. You will require a **C-compiler**, preferably `gcc`.

### Procedure

Before running any project, you need to clone this repository.

1. Open a Terminal, and enter the following command.
	```
	git clone https://github.com/rafi007akhtar/oslab.git
	```

2. Once cloned, enter the root directory of the project.
	```
	cd oslab
	```

3. Pick any implemented project you want, and run them. 

You will find most projects with their own READMEs, having detailed instructions on how to link, compile and execute them. Most of them even contain demo pictures and animations to demonstrate an example execution.

## Testing environment
All programs were created and executed on a **Linux Debian** virtual OS running atop my Windows 8.1 native OS via VMware Workstation.

The Debian virtual OS I used was the official virtual OS provided as a student resource here: http://www.os-book.com/ 

### Disclaimer
<ul>
	<li> Starter codes for some projects were readily available in the virtual OS. I only had to add upon them as per the instructions given in the book.
	<li> <strong>I have not copied the code from elsewhere, nor do I claim the code to be error free or the official solutions. 
	Please <em>do not</em> copy-paste my code as homework solutions.</strong>
	<li> In case of any error, feel free to create an Issue, or email me: <a href="mailto:alimdrafi@gmail.com" target="_blank"> alimdrafi@gmail.com </a>
