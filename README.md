# oslab
Operating System-based projects explored and implemented chapter-wise. 
The programs are inspired from end-of-chapter projects in Silberchatz's _Operating System Concepts_.

## List of projects fully implemented
<li> Linux Kernel Modules (Chapter #2) <br>
<li> Simple UNIX Shell (Chapter #3) <br>

The chapter numbers are concurrent with Silberchatz's _Operating System Concepts_, 9th edition.

## Testing environment
All programs were created and executed on a **Linux Debian** virtual OS running atop my Windows 8.1 native OS via VMware Workstation.

The Debian virtual OS I used was the official virtual OS provided as a student resource here: http://www.os-book.com/ 

### Disclaimer
<li> All the starter code for each project was readily available in the virtual OS. I only had to add upon them as per the instructions given in the book. I did not create the programs from scratch.
<li> I have not copied the code from elsewhere, nor do I claim the code to be error free or the official solutions. 
Please <em>do not</em> copy-paste my code as homework solutions.
<li> In case of any error, feel free to email me: <a href="mailto:alimdrafi@gmail.com" target="_blank"> alimdrafi@gmail.com </a>
